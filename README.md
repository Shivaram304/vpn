#  Task 8: VPN Setup & Privacy

## 📌 Objective
To explore how VPNs protect online privacy by encrypting traffic and masking IP addresses. This task involved setting up a free VPN, verifying IP changes, and evaluating browsing behavior through encrypted tunnels.

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. **VPN Selection & Installation**
   - Chose **ProtonVPN (Free Plan)** for its strong privacy policy and user-friendly interface.
   - Installed the ProtonVPN desktop client and signed in with a free account.

2. **VPN Connection**
   - Connected to a free server (India region).
   - Verified "Connected" status in the client UI.

3. **IP Address Check**
   - Visited [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).
   - Observed that the IP had changed from my real location to the VPN server.

4. **Encrypted Browsing Test**
   - Visited HTTPS websites such as  `https://google.com`.
   - Verified the 🔒 padlock symbol confirming secure (encrypted) communication.
   - Used [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net) to verify DNS and IP tunneling.

5. **Disconnection & Speed Comparison**
   - Disconnected from the VPN.
   - Compared browsing speeds using [speedtest.net](https://fast.com) before and after.
   - VPN reduced speed slightly due to encryption overhead.
